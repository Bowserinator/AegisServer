[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: and && = and, || = or
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: ok onto classes
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: mhm
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: most classes you're probably going to use are inherited from object class
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: u can make simpler classes but most people use this
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: so ehh
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: lets start with this
[11:01PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: class ClassName(object):
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: def __init__(self,args here):
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: __init__ is the default function called when u make a class
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: u can override operators too
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Constructor?
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: yeah
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: pretty muh
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: o, opereator overriding, so nice
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: for example in the class def __str__(self): #Returns string
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: makes it return a string of your choice when u do str(class)
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: there's a ton of special functions you can override
[11:02PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: anyways
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Good
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: inside __init__
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: u can do
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: self.varaible = something
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: self.varaible2 = arg1
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: etc...
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: u can make functions inside the class
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: def func(self,args):
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: No I mean
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: u must have self as first argument
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: What's self?
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: o, mhm
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: as in python it passes itself to run the function
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: so when u do class.function()
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: it runs a function with arguments (class, other arguments)
[11:03PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: mhm
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Ah, nice
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: So is there a difference between storing stuff in self and storing as global vars?
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: yes
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: oh yeah
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: to make global variable
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: do global varname = something
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: global variables are not recommended
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: use self and modules
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Okay, nice
[11:04PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: to make a class do varaible = ClassName()
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: that's pretty much it
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: what else?
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: hm, so easy
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: yes
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: custom errors?
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: um, well one thing
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: yes?
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Nah not those, I don't even know them in other languages
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: But um
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: custom errors: class ErrorName(Exception): pass
[11:05PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Naming conventions?
[11:06PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: varaible_names_underscore_usually
[11:06PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: functions_underscore_too or functionCapsNewWords
[11:06PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: ClassesCapEachLetterUsually
[11:06PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: same as Java and C++
[11:06PM-May 12, 2016] [OverCoder][pisg/dev/OverCoder]: Okay
[11:06PM-May 12, 2016] [Bowserinator][unaffiliated/bowserinator]: except functions can be named as varaibles

[07:00PM-May 24, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: +S only allows SSL users (chanserv does not remove this on RECOVER), +i (invite-only), +l 1 (allows only 1 user), +k randomstuff (password-only)

[07:04PM-May 24, 2016] [jeffl36][unaffiliated/jeffl35]: why...
[07:04PM-May 24, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: +Q...?
[07:04PM-May 24, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: That's a user mode AFAIK
[07:04PM-May 24, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: That disallows being forwarded

[07:04PM-May 24, 2016] [jeffl36][unaffiliated/jeffl35]: so +FQ is technically contradictory

[03:29AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]: DESCRIPTION
[03:29AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        FIGlet prints its input using large characters (called ``FIGcharacters'')made up of ordinary screen char‐
[03:29AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        acters (called ``sub-characters'').  FIGlet output is generally reminiscent of the sort of ``signatures''
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]: OPTIONS
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        FIGlet  reads  command line options from left to right, and only the last option that affects a parameter
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        has any effect.  Almost every option has an inverse, so that, for example, if FIGlet is customized with a
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        shell alias, all the options are usually still available.
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        Commonly-used options are -f, -c, -k, -t, -p and -v.
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        -f fontfile
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               Select  the font.  The .flf suffix may be left off of fontfile, in which case FIGlet automatically
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               appends it.  FIGlet looks for the file first in the default font directory and then in the current
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               directory, or, if fontfile was given as a full pathname, in the given directory.  If the -f option
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               is not specified, FIGlet uses the font that was specified when it was compiled.  To find out which
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               font this is, use the -I3 option.

[03:55AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]: DESCRIPTION
[03:55AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        FIGlet prints its input using large characters (called ``FIGcharacters'')made up of ordinary screen char‐
[03:55AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        acters (called ``sub-characters'').  FIGlet output is generally reminiscent of the sort of ``signatures''
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]: OPTIONS
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        FIGlet  reads  command line options from left to right, and only the last option that affects a parameter
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        has any effect.  Almost every option has an inverse, so that, for example, if FIGlet is customized with a
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        shell alias, all the options are usually still available.
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        Commonly-used options are -f, -c, -k, -t, -p and -v.
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        -f fontfile
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               Select  the font.  The .flf suffix may be left off of fontfile, in which case FIGlet automatically
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               appends it.  FIGlet looks for the file first in the default font directory and then in the current
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               directory, or, if fontfile was given as a full pathname, in the given directory.  If the -f option
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               is not specified, FIGlet uses the font that was specified when it was compiled.  To find out which
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               font this is, use the -I3 option.

[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        -d fontdirectory
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               Change the default font directory.  FIGlet looks for fonts first in the default directory and then
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               FIGcharacter, in its entirety, on a separate line, no matter how wide it is.

[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        -p
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        -n     These  options control how FIGlet handles newlines.  -p puts FIGlet into ``paragraph mode'', which
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               eliminates some unnecessary line breaks when piping a multi-line file through  FIGlet.   In  para‐
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               graph  mode,  FIGlet  treats  line breaks within a paragraph as if they were merely blanks between
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               words.  (Specifically, -p causes FIGlet to convert any newline which is not preceded by a  newline
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               and  not followed by a space character into a blank.)  -n (default) puts FIGlet back to normal, in
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               which every newline FIGlet reads causes it to produce a line break.

[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               turns into s-z.  -E turns off -D processing.  These options are deprecated, which means they prob‐

[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               The  difference  between -s and -S is that -s will not smush a font whose author specified kerning

[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:  
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               If there is no information in the font about how to smush, or if the -o option is specified,  then
[03:56AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:               the  FIGcharacters  are  ``overlapped''.  This means that after kerning, the first subcharacter of

[03:57AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:                      Similarly, version 3.7.2 would print ``30702''.  These numbers are guaranteed to be ascend‐

[03:57AM-May 29, 2016] [Jeffbot][unaffiliated/jeffl35/bot/jeffbot]:        For  this reason, FIGlet defaults to 80 column output.  If you are using a wider terminal, and would like
