[12:04AM-May 16, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: we would need to overwrite socket.sleep with a coroutine timer
[12:04AM-May 16, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: which we can do
[12:04AM-May 16, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: JZTech1O1: that was irc send lag, not cpu frozen because sleep() lag
[12:04AM-May 16, 2016] [JZTech1O1][botters/jztech101]: oh right.

[12:05AM-May 16, 2016] [JZTech1O1][botters/jztech101]: It's funny. Having multithreaded bots, on a "single-threaded" input
[12:05AM-May 16, 2016] [JZTech1O1][botters/jztech101]: lol
[12:05AM-May 16, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: cracker64, if you could make it a coroutine timer that would be a lot nicer
[12:05AM-May 16, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: you could probably make an alias to do a timer
[12:05AM-May 16, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: I think it already supports it
[12:05AM-May 16, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: and that would be incredibly useful for normal people to use too
[12:06AM-May 16, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: just use a 'coroutine.yield' in place of sleep
[12:06AM-May 16, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: it should support a seconds argument and sleep that long

[12:16AM-May 22, 2016] [jeffl36][unaffiliated/jeffl35]: because if it initializes the sandbox every time, it kinda defeats the purpose

[12:17AM-May 22, 2016] [jeffl36][unaffiliated/jeffl35]: Oh, ok
[12:17AM-May 22, 2016] [zz][pisg/dev/zz]: 'hue' being the name and dir being the item itself
[12:17AM-May 22, 2016] [jeffl36][unaffiliated/jeffl35]: ok
[12:17AM-May 22, 2016] [jeffl36][unaffiliated/jeffl35]: does Repl() initialize the sandbox?

[12:20AM-May 22, 2016] [zz][pisg/dev/zz]: it would yes
[12:20AM-May 22, 2016] [zz][pisg/dev/zz]: you may want to set 'sandbox' at the start of your code
