[01:49AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> I think it needs container trust

[01:50AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> they are to stop pigmen spawns on ice
[01:50AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> and then the second is to stop pigmen spawns on that one
[01:50AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> I mean, the ones floating over the sides
[01:50AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> those are so you don't fall off

[01:54AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> it's actually all single slabs
[01:55AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> i'm not sure if I want to trim the edges

[01:59AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> it doesn't, I just want the slabs back

[02:00AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> they do

[02:01AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> not over bedrock
[02:01AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> jacob614, you had an error in ice

[02:02AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> That made the slab thing shift
[02:03AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> lol then, I guess that is fine
[02:03AM-May 09, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> it would require changing everything past this point to really fix

[04:35PM-May 18, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: they added polar bear of course, a new version of zombies that spawn in deserts and a new version of skeletons
[04:36PM-May 18, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: the desert zombie mob thing is called the husk, he gives you hunger effect when he attacks you
[04:36PM-May 18, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: the skeleton thing is called the stray and his arrows effect you with slowness
[04:38PM-May 18, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: they added bone block, nether wart block, magma block, which deals damage when you step on it, structure block and structure void and a new red-ish version of nether brick blocks

[04:35PM-May 20, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: magma blocks can store light
[04:36PM-May 20, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: normally, it's very dim, when you put a light source near it, it will store the amount of light it receives from that light source and keep it even after you remove the light source
[04:37PM-May 20, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: so if you place a glow stone in a place where the magma block receives light level of 5 and remove the glow stone, it will emit light level 5
[04:38PM-May 20, 2016] [Mrprocom][unaffiliated/mrprocom]: so it's pretty much a controllable light emitter

[02:51PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> so I had to open it and hit "extract"
[02:51PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> it's a really nice feature, it just wasn't explained in the post

[02:53PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> It's behind normal azure portal
[02:53PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> There is a cobble thing

[02:53PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> Go to 15, -80 nether
[02:53PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> ok
[02:54PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> with optifine I can get 60fps no problem, yay

[02:56PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> I should go into bios settings to reverse the fn keys...
[02:56PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> I have to do fn+f3 now
[02:56PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> Why fn?
[02:57PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <jacob614> because by default, f3 is a volume up button
[02:57PM-May 21, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> It should be different, like for me fn+f6 is volume up

[08:13PM-May 27, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: I do think the method of finding slime chunks right now is stupid, maybe I could attempt to add a command to do that

[12:51AM-May 29, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: jacob1, why ##powder-mc is a double hash channel?
[12:51AM-May 29, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: PD: Do you care if we use ##powder-mc/Azure
[12:52AM-May 29, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: because someone owns #powder-mc
[12:52AM-May 29, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: well, you can use it, although an invite might be nice
[12:52AM-May 29, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: sorry iovoid, the last ban giveaway went to Minotaur
[12:52AM-May 29, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: I don't think he noticed though

[12:56AM-May 29, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: Well, that channel is kind of unused and replaced by #ezzybot
[12:58AM-May 29, 2016] [jacob1][Powder/Developer/jacob1]: ok
[12:59AM-May 29, 2016] [iovoid][unaffiliated/iovoid]: #ezzybot has more users than this channel, but 7 less than -bots

[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: next goal: kill it with punches with no armor and 4 stacks of diamonds in inventory
[03:30AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> lol
[03:31AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> When I get 4 stakcs of diamonds...

[03:31AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> when I get 20 diamonds...
[03:31AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> I could use Mineblock's
[03:32AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> Also add to be in a single block over a lava ocean with no fire potion
[03:36AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> Next goal: kill ender dragon with no armor using punchs, with slowness I and weakness L
[03:36AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: nah that is unreasonale, there are no blocks, and you have to catch the ghast by building with End Rods
[03:37AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: over a lava lake of course
[03:37AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> give slowness 200 to it
[03:37AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: or regen
[03:40AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> did you read MC guide of how to reactivate your nether portal just with nether stuff

[03:41AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: oh, no I don't think so
[03:41AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: ghast fire?
[03:41AM-May 29, 2016] [potatorelay][unaffiliated/jacob1/bot/jacobot]: <iovoid> Kill a ghast (gunpowder), a blaze (blaze powder) and a wither skeleton to make a fireball to lit fir
[03:41AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: or some crazy burning with lava
[03:41AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: sure ok
[03:42AM-May 29, 2016] [cracker64][Powder/Developer/cracker64]: if you can manage to kill all that, possibly early game
